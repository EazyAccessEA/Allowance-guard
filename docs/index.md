# AllowanceGuard Documentation

*Last reviewed: 12 September 2025*

AllowanceGuard is a Web3 security platform that enables users to discover, understand and control every token approval associated with their wallets. It exposes the permissions granted to smart contracts across supported chains, evaluates them for risk and provides a streamlined mechanism for revoking or adjusting them. This prevents silent or long-forgotten approvals from being exploited and restores control to the wallet owner. The platform also incorporates an alert and automation system that continually monitors for changes and warns users about new or high-risk approvals, giving them a real-time picture of their security posture.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a complete reference for AllowanceGuard's capabilities and architecture. It explains how token approvals work under ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, how the platform integrates with external APIs to read on-chain data, how it constructs revoke transactions and how its policy and alert engine functions. It also details best practices for using AllowanceGuard safely, including the limitations of revocation and the importance of ongoing monitoring. Throughout the documentation, every section links to reputable sources such as revoke.cash, Ethereum.org and official EIP specifications to support accuracy and currency.

Readers will learn how to connect a wallet to AllowanceGuard, view and interpret every token approval, assess each permission's risk level, revoke or modify approvals directly from the dashboard, configure automated alerts and understand what the platform can and cannot do. Advanced users and developers will find guidance on API integrations, cron-based monitoring, risk-scoring heuristics and secure storage of alert policies. The documentation maintains a clear, professional tone to ensure that technical and non-technical audiences alike can understand its instructions.

By combining a transparent view of wallet permissions with instant control and proactive alerting, AllowanceGuard acts as a critical layer of security for any DeFi participant. This documentation provides not only the practical steps to use the platform but also the conceptual background to understand why those steps matter.
