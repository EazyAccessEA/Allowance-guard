# Risk Scoring System

*Last reviewed: 12 September 2025*

AllowanceGuard's risk-scoring model is designed to give users an at-a-glance understanding of which approvals deserve immediate attention. The model considers factors such as unlimited spending permissions, known malicious addresses, contract age, and behavioural heuristics drawn from on-chain data. Scores are assigned to each approval and displayed alongside the spender and token information.

This documentation explains how the scoring system works conceptually, while making clear that no automated model can perfectly predict risk. Users are encouraged to use the scores as a prioritisation aid rather than a definitive judgment. The section also references external threat intelligence sources and describes how AllowanceGuard integrates such data into its assessments.
