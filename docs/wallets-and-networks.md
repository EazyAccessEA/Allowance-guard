# Supported Wallets and Networks

*Last reviewed: 12 September 2025*

AllowanceGuard supports multiple networks and wallet types, enabling users to monitor token approvals across a wide range of environments. Connecting a wallet through MetaMask or another Web3 provider allows the platform to query balances and approvals for that address. For users who prefer not to connect directly, AllowanceGuard also accepts a manually entered address. This documentation explains how the platform interfaces with networks via RPC endpoints, how it manages rate limits and how it reconciles data from different explorers.

Hardware wallets provide an additional layer of security but still rely on the same approval mechanisms. AllowanceGuard's guidance includes best practices for using hardware wallets with decentralised applications, including verifying approvals before signing and regularly checking allowances even on cold storage addresses. By understanding how networks and wallets interact, users can deploy AllowanceGuard more effectively and maintain a clear view of their permissions.
