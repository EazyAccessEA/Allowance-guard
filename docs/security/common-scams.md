# Common Scams and Attack Vectors

*Last reviewed: 12 September 2025*

The decentralised finance ecosystem has become a target for a range of scams that exploit token approvals and wallet permissions. One of the most prevalent is address poisoning, where attackers create fake addresses resembling legitimate ones to trick users into signing approvals. Another common tactic involves phishing dApps that request excessive or hidden permissions under the guise of a legitimate transaction. Because approvals persist until revoked, these attacks can have long-term consequences if not promptly addressed.

AllowanceGuard's approach to mitigating these threats involves providing real-time visibility of every approval, flagging known malicious or suspicious spenders and scoring approvals based on risk. However, users must still exercise caution when signing any transaction or message. This documentation explains how these scams work, why they succeed and what preventative measures users can adopt, including verifying spender addresses and limiting allowances to only the necessary amounts. It also references authoritative sources such as revoke.cash and Ethereum security advisories to provide deeper context.

By understanding common scams and how they relate to token approvals, users of AllowanceGuard can make informed decisions and use the platform to actively manage their risk exposure.
