# Post-Incident Security Checklist

*Last reviewed: 12 September 2025*

If a wallet is suspected of compromise, rapid and systematic action is required to limit further damage. AllowanceGuard provides a toolset to help, but it is important to understand what it can and cannot do. This documentation outlines the recommended steps after an incident, beginning with revoking all high-risk approvals, transferring remaining assets to a secure wallet and monitoring for suspicious activity.

AllowanceGuard can assist by scanning all token approvals immediately, identifying unlimited or malicious permissions and generating revoke transactions. However, it cannot recover stolen funds or prevent new approvals from being granted if the attacker retains control of the private keys. Users are advised to treat AllowanceGuard as a mitigation and visibility tool rather than a complete recovery service. This section provides references to incident response guides from reputable security organisations and gives readers a framework for reducing ongoing risk after a breach.
