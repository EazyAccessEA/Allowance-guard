# Allowance Guard 2.0 -- 60-Day Sprint Plan

This document details the week-by-week execution plan (Week 0 through
Week 8) for building **Allowance Guard 2.0**, focusing on implementation
tasks, deliverables, and rigorous success criteria per role. All work
adheres to **PuredgeOS 3.0** "God-tier" standards for clarity,
performance, accessibility, and design consistency.

## Week 0 -- Planning & Setup

-   **Architect:** Define the overall system architecture and tech
    stack. Outline microservices and data flow (wallet indexer → risk
    engine → alert pipeline) and how the frontend, backend, and smart
    contracts integrate. *Deliverable:* Architecture blueprint (diagrams
    and spec) reviewed by all leads. *Success Criteria:* Document
    clearly defines all components, interactions, and data schemas; plan
    includes clarity-first UX enforcement (mapping features to the 10
    Clarity Pillars
    tests[\[1\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20we%20maintain%20a%20Clarity,key%20pages%20to%20capture%20pillar))
    and telemetry points for clarity metrics (e.g. plan to capture
    glanceability, error
    rates[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20)).
    All leads sign off, confirming the design meets security
    requirements and PuredgeOS standards.

-   **Product Owner:** Finalize requirements and user stories for core
    features (allowance dashboard, risk scoring, revocation, alerts,
    "Time Machine" simulator). Define acceptance criteria that
    incorporate clarity metrics and quality gates (e.g. *"User can
    identify the main action within 5s (Blink
    Test)[\[3\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=The%205,immediately%20clear%2C%20deeply%20engaging%2C%20and);
    error rate \<2% on revocation
    flow[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20)"*).
    *Deliverable:* Product backlog with prioritized user stories and
    Definition of Done for each. *Success Criteria:* Every user story
    has clear success metrics (time-to-first-action, task success %,
    etc.) and links to a Clarity Pillar or performance requirement.
    Backlog reviewed with team to ensure shared understanding.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Begin high-level UX design with a
    **clarity-first approach**. Sketch key screens (dashboard, approval
    detail, alerts, simulation screen) emphasizing immediate purpose and
    intuitive next steps. Define initial content strategy and microcopy
    adhering to brand voice (e.g. confident, human tone) and simplicity
    (target \~8th grade reading
    level[\[4\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=until%20needed%29,and%20check%20if%20it%20stays)).
    *Deliverables:* Low-fidelity wireframes and content draft for core
    screens; draft of UI text. *Success Criteria:* Design review
    confirms each screen passes preliminary clarity tests (e.g. a
    5-second Blink Test on wireframes shows users grasp the
    purpose[\[3\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=The%205,immediately%20clear%2C%20deeply%20engaging%2C%20and)).
    All copy avoids jargon and meets reading level targets (verified via
    readability tools).

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** Research and design any on-chain
    component needed. Plan how to handle token allowance revocations
    (e.g. via direct `approve(0)` calls or a custom **BatchRevoke**
    smart contract if multi-revoke in one transaction is needed).
    Identify security considerations (reentrancy, minimal permissions)
    and gas cost optimization for revoking allowances. *Deliverable:*
    Smart contract design outline (or decision to use existing
    standards) and a security checklist. *Success Criteria:* Design is
    reviewed by Security Researcher -- confirms no known vulnerabilities
    or trust issues. If a custom contract is planned, a test plan for
    audit is outlined.

-   **Backend Lead:** Design the backend architecture (services,
    database) for indexing allowances and serving the frontend. Decide
    on approach for the **allowance indexer** (e.g. using The Graph or
    custom indexer polling chain events) and the risk scoring engine
    (rule-based initially, possibly ML later). Set up the base code
    repository for backend with frameworks (Node.js/TypeScript or
    similar) and instantiate a basic service structure. *Deliverable:*
    Backend stack setup (repo, project structure) and written plan for
    data flow (how allowance data is stored and updated, API endpoints
    for frontend). *Success Criteria:* Repo passes initial CI setup
    (linting, tests scaffold). Chosen approach supports required
    networks (e.g. Ethereum mainnet) and scales for user load. Plan
    reviewed by Architect for consistency with overall design.

-   **Frontend Lead:** Set up the frontend project (e.g. React 18 +
    Tailwind CSS 3.4 as per PuredgeOS
    guidelines[\[5\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=coherence,4)).
    Implement design tokens for **brand identity** (colors, typography,
    spacing) according to PuredgeOS 3.0 style guide (use provided
    palette tokens -- Obsidian, Serum Teal,
    etc.[\[6\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=Color%20Palette%3A%20Our%20official%20brand,adding%20a%20modern%2C%20energetic%20vibe)[\[7\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=These%20colors%20have%20been%20tested,provided%20they%20meet%20contrast%20guidance)).
    *Deliverables:* Initial React app scaffolding with global
    style/theme applied; placeholder components for key pages. *Success
    Criteria:* App builds and runs with no errors. All colors and fonts
    are from the approved token set (no ad-hoc "color
    drift"[\[7\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=These%20colors%20have%20been%20tested,provided%20they%20meet%20contrast%20guidance)).
    Basic accessibility checks (e.g. high contrast mode, scalable text)
    show no blockers. Frontend Lead and UX Designer verify the design
    system foundation is ready for feature development.

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Initialize CI/CD pipelines and development
    environments. Set up repository integrations for automated testing
    (unit test runner), linting, and preview deploys. Integrate
    **quality gates** early: for example, configure Lighthouse CI and
    Axe audits to run on each frontend build (even if just a hello-world
    page) to catch regressions. Establish performance budgets now (e.g.
    alert if bundle \> X KB or if initial LCP \> 2.5s in test) in
    anticipation of later
    enforcement[\[8\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=Core%20Web%20Vitals%20Budgets%3A%20As,Lighthouse%29%20and%20monitor).
    *Deliverable:* CI pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions or similar)
    running on push. *Success Criteria:* Pipeline runs lint and test
    jobs automatically. Any failure (lint, tests) blocks merges. Basic
    Lighthouse/Axe run passes (greenfield project). Documented CI/CD
    process in README for team.

-   **Security Researcher:** Perform an initial threat modeling
    exercise. Identify key risks (e.g. malicious smart contracts,
    phishing via the app, abuse of the revoke function) and define
    security requirements for each component. Review the planned
    architecture and smart contract design for potential
    vulnerabilities. *Deliverable:* Threat Model report listing top
    threats and mitigation plans (secure coding practices, required
    audits, etc.). *Success Criteria:* Architect and engineers
    acknowledge and integrate recommendations (e.g. input validation on
    addresses, rate limiting API to avoid DoS, content security policy
    on frontend). Any critical concerns are resolved or added to backlog
    with owner.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Outline the strategy for the **risk engine** and
    data collection. Decide if any machine learning or heuristics will
    be used to classify risky allowances (e.g. flag known scam
    contracts, unusually large allowances). Identify data sources: e.g.
    list of malicious addresses, token metadata, past exploits. Also
    plan telemetry schema to capture user interaction data for future ML
    (e.g. logging which allowances users revoke vs ignore).
    *Deliverable:* Data strategy memo defining risk scoring approach
    (initial rule-based criteria and ML opportunities) and telemetry
    events list needed. *Success Criteria:* Memo approved by Product
    Owner and Security (for privacy). It includes clear criteria for
    "high risk" vs "low risk" allowances and outlines how the system
    will gather needed data. Telemetry plan covers key events (e.g.
    allowance viewed, revoked, simulated) without violating user
    privacy.

-   **Growth Marketer:** Develop a pre-launch marketing plan. Identify
    target user personas and communities (e.g. DeFi users concerned with
    wallet security) and craft core messaging that highlights
    **Allowance Guard 2.0's clarity and safety**. Plan early outreach:
    waitlist or teaser site, social media announcements. *Deliverable:*
    Marketing roadmap (timeline of campaigns, content pieces, community
    outreach) for the 60-day sprint. *Success Criteria:* Product Owner
    approves messaging as accurate and clear. A teaser landing page is
    prepared (even if basic) with a concise value proposition. Early
    sign-up or interest metrics (if applicable) start to be collected.

-   **Support Lead:** Prepare the support structure for the new product.
    Choose support channels (e.g. Intercom chat, email or a Discord
    community for beta users). Draft a template Knowledge Base article,
    FAQ, or user guide outlining what Allowance Guard does and how to
    use an approval revoker (keeping language very simple and clear).
    *Deliverable:* Support plan and draft documentation for onboarding
    and common questions. *Success Criteria:* Documentation is reviewed
    by UX Writer for clarity (meets reading level
    target[\[4\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=until%20needed%29,and%20check%20if%20it%20stays)
    and uses consistent tone). Support tools are set up or requested
    (e.g. support email or chat widget ready by launch). The team is
    aware of how user feedback/bugs will be collected and addressed
    during the beta.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Identify legal and compliance needs from the
    outset. Review the product concept for any regulatory or policy
    implications (e.g. does monitoring allowances or sending security
    alerts constitute financial advice or require disclaimers?). Start
    drafting Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, ensuring they cover
    use of blockchain data and telemetry collection (in compliance with
    GDPR and other privacy
    laws[\[9\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=,from%20design%20to%20deployment)).
    *Deliverable:* List of legal requirements/considerations and initial
    draft of ToS/Privacy. *Success Criteria:* No red-flag legal issues;
    Product Owner agrees on any user consent needed (e.g. for
    telemetry). Legal drafts exist for team review, covering liability
    (not responsible for missed exploits, etc.) and compliance (privacy,
    open-source licenses for used components).

## Week 1 -- Core Architecture & Design Finalization

-   **Architect:** Finalize detailed component design and interface
    contracts between systems. Produce API interface specs for
    frontend-backend and any backend-contract interactions (e.g.
    function signatures for revoke transactions). Ensure all designs
    enforce *Clarity First* law (e.g. error flows and edge cases are
    designed to fail transparently, not silently). *Deliverable:*
    Updated architecture spec with interface definitions and a **Clarity
    Compliance Checklist** for each planned feature (which Clarity
    Pillars apply and how to test them). *Success Criteria:* All
    engineers understand the module boundaries and data models (checked
    via a team architecture walkthrough). The clarity checklist is
    reviewed in the daily stand-up -- everyone knows how we'll test
    Blink Test, 5-year-old comprehension, etc. for their feature.

-   **Product Owner:** Break down Week 1--4 goals into a sprint plan.
    Refine user stories with the team's input from Week 0 outcomes.
    Adjust scope if needed to keep the timeline (identify any
    "nice-to-have" features that can be cut or deferred if we fall
    behind, to prioritize a shippable core). *Deliverable:* Sprint
    backlog for Weeks 1--4 (MVP) locked in, with stories assigned to the
    appropriate owners. *Success Criteria:* Team commits to the sprint
    scope. Each story has clear acceptance tests (including *Clarity
    Pillar tests* where relevant -- e.g. a story for the dashboard
    includes a Blink Test verification). No blockers identified for
    current sprint.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Evolve wireframes to **high-fidelity
    designs** for core screens using PuredgeOS brand elements. Apply
    official color palette, typography, and components (using the design
    tokens prepared) to create pixel-perfect mocks. Ensure contrast and
    hierarchy are optimal -- primary actions should visually dominate
    (e.g. using Serum Teal for
    CTAs)[\[10\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%20%20%20,lime%20green%2Fyellow%2C%20used%20sparingly%20for).
    Refine microcopy for clarity and consistency (e.g. button labels
    like "Revoke Allowance" instead of "Submit"). *Deliverables:* Figma
    (or similar) high-fidelity designs of main user flows; updated copy
    deck. *Success Criteria:* Design review with Product Owner and
    Frontend Lead: all visual components meet WCAG AA contrast (verified
    via design tools), important elements pass the 5-second glance test
    (stakeholders can point out the primary action immediately), and
    copy is on-brand and at reading level (validated via a quick
    readability scan). Sign-off given to begin frontend implementation.

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** Start coding the smart contract (if
    needed) or integrate with existing contracts. For a custom
    BatchRevoke contract, implement functions to batch revoke allowances
    safely. Write unit tests covering core scenarios (e.g. single
    allowance revoke, multiple, edge cases like no allowances). If using
    only direct calls, prepare scripts or library integration for
    revocation transactions. *Deliverable:* Smart contract code (or
    transaction module) in a repository with test coverage \>90%.
    *Success Criteria:* All tests pass (run in CI). Gas costs are within
    acceptable limits (e.g. revoking 5 allowances in batch costs less
    than 5 separate tx). Security Researcher reviews code for any
    obvious issues; no critical vulnerabilities found at this stage.

-   **Backend Lead:** Develop the **Allowance Indexer** minimal viable
    product. If using an external API or The Graph, implement calls to
    fetch a user's allowances on Ethereum (ERC-20 approvals to start).
    Set up a database (or in-memory cache) to store fetched allowances
    and their metadata (token name, contract risk info). Implement a
    basic REST/GraphQL API endpoint: `GET /allowances?wallet=xyz`
    returning current allowances. *Deliverable:* Running backend service
    that can return a sample wallet's allowances data. *Success
    Criteria:* Deployed to a dev environment (or local) and returns
    correct data for test wallet. Performance check: fetching and
    responding with allowances is under e.g. 2 seconds for a wallet with
    100 allowances. Frontend can hit this API (even if stubbed) without
    errors. Verify that sensitive data is not stored (only public
    blockchain data and user wallet address).

-   **Frontend Lead:** Implement the **dashboard UI** skeleton. Create
    components for allowance list, with placeholder data (until real API
    is connected). Integrate wallet connection (e.g. via web3 provider
    like MetaMask). Ensure the basic layout matches the high-fidelity
    design and is responsive. Incorporate loading states and error
    states in UI (even if not fully wired) to uphold Pillar 4 (system
    status is always
    visible)[\[11\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=6,29).
    *Deliverable:* Interactive frontend prototype where a user can
    connect a wallet and see a dummy list of allowances. *Success
    Criteria:* On connecting a wallet (test with MetaMask on a test
    network), the app displays a placeholder allowance table. The UI
    elements (buttons, text) use the design token styles exactly. No
    contrast or accessibility regressions (quick Axe audit shows zero
    critical issues). The primary call-to-action (e.g. "Revoke" button)
    is clearly distinguishable and labeled, passing affordance clarity
    tests (testers immediately know its function).

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Set up development and testing infrastructure.
    Provision a **testnet** environment (e.g. connect to Ethereum Goerli
    or a local blockchain) for safe testing of allowance revokes.
    Configure environment variables/secrets management for API keys (if
    using Etherscan or third-party data). Enhance CI: add a basic test
    stage for the smart contract (Truffle/Hardhat tests) and backend
    (run unit tests, lint). Start configuring automated **coverage
    reports** and **static analysis** (e.g. Slither for smart contracts,
    ESLint for code quality). *Deliverable:* Updated CI pipeline
    including backend and contract tests, plus integrated reports
    (coverage %, lint results). *Success Criteria:* CI pipeline runs all
    test suites successfully. Any lint or static analysis warnings are
    addressed or added to backlog. Team can easily deploy the dev build
    (frontend + backend) in a test environment (manual or
    pipeline-triggered) for integration testing next week.

-   **Security Researcher:** Provide security input on implementation
    details emerging this week. Review the wallet connection
    implementation and ensure no unsafe practices (e.g. make sure we
    never ask for private keys, only use standard wallet provider).
    Review the smart contract code progress, checking for common
    solidity issues (if applicable). Begin drafting a **security test
    plan** for later (including what to pentest in the app, any
    third-party audit needed for contracts). *Deliverable:* Security
    review notes on code and configuration (shared with engineers).
    *Success Criteria:* Any critical findings are fixed immediately
    (e.g. if a dependency has a known vulnerability, the team replaces
    it). The application architecture still holds against threat model
    assumptions after seeing real code. A plan is laid out for
    comprehensive security testing by Week 6.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Implement initial **Risk Scoring Engine** logic.
    Create a simple module or script that takes an allowance entry
    (token, spender address, allowance amount) and returns a risk rating
    (e.g. High, Medium, Low) based on rules (e.g. "High if unlimited
    allowance to an unverified contract, Medium if large allowance to
    known protocol, etc."). Integrate a small database of known
    malicious addresses for testing (could use a static list or API).
    *Deliverable:* Risk scoring function integrated into the backend
    pipeline (called when allowances are fetched, appending risk field).
    *Success Criteria:* Example allowances run through the engine
    produce sensible scores (manually verified). Document the rationale
    for each risk rule for transparency. The frontend (or a test script)
    can retrieve allowances with a risk label attached. Ready to iterate
    on with more data.

-   **Growth Marketer:** Launch the **teaser landing page** (if not
    live, do it now). Include a clear headline and call-to-action (e.g.
    "Coming Soon: Your Web3 Financial Immune System"). Ensure the page
    itself follows clarity best practices: one primary message, short
    description, and an email signup. *Deliverable:* Live landing page
    and/or announcement on social channels. *Success Criteria:* Page
    passes a quick clarity check (first-time visitors can tell what the
    product will do within seconds). Collect at least an initial set of
    sign-ups or interest (\~X sign-ups goal, if applicable). Marketing
    materials are reviewed by UX Writer to ensure tone and clarity align
    with product.

-   **Support Lead:** Set up internal testing protocols. Define how
    support will simulate user issues during development (e.g. someone
    from support tests each new feature as if they were a user, to
    provide early feedback on UX clarity and potential questions).
    Update the FAQ draft with any new questions that arose from
    development discussions ("What is an allowance?", "How does risk
    score work?"). *Deliverable:* Internal testing checklist for support
    to run through for each feature release (including clarity checks
    like "Is the purpose of this feature obvious?"). *Success Criteria:*
    Support team (even if one person) is involved in weekly feature
    demos and logs any confusion or potential user issues. The FAQ now
    covers at least the fundamental concepts of allowances, revoking,
    and the added features of Allowance Guard.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Continue drafting user-facing policies. By end
    of Week 1, have a solid **Terms of Service** draft covering user
    responsibilities (e.g. "user must use at their own risk"), liability
    limits, and an outline of how the revocation transactions work (to
    avoid any user misunderstandings). Also outline the **Privacy
    Policy** specifics: what data we collect (wallet addresses, on-chain
    data, telemetry), how it's used (security improvements, not sold,
    etc.), and how users can opt out if possible. *Deliverable:* ToS and
    Privacy Policy drafts ready for internal review. *Success Criteria:*
    Legal documents reviewed by Product Owner and no major issues
    raised. Compliance check: all planned telemetry is compliant (e.g.
    if storing any personal data like emails for alerts, ensure consent
    flows are planned). Legal confirms there are no regulatory blocks
    for launch (e.g. product does not fall under financial advisor
    regulations since it's a security tool, but disclaimers will clarify
    that).

## Week 2 -- MVP Feature Development

-   **Architect:** Oversee integration of components as the MVP comes
    together. Ensure the data contracts between front-end, back-end, and
    smart contract (if any) are aligning -- e.g. the frontend's
    expectations for API `/allowances` match exactly what backend
    delivers. Tweak architecture if needed based on Week 1 findings (for
    example, if The Graph API is too slow, pivot to direct RPC calls).
    *Deliverable:* Updated architecture and integration notes (if
    changes). *Success Criteria:* Mid-week architecture review confirms
    no major gaps: the front-end is unblocked waiting for data, the
    backend can call any smart contract functions as planned. All
    engineers clearly understand the end-to-end flow of "user views
    allowance -\> sees risk -\> clicks revoke -\> transaction goes to
    blockchain -\> UI updates".

-   **Product Owner:** Conduct a mid-sprint check on the MVP scope.
    Re-prioritize tasks if something is lagging (e.g. if smart contract
    development is slow, decide if a simpler approach can be used to
    keep timeline). Begin drafting **acceptance test scripts** for the
    MVP: step-by-step test cases for key flows (connect wallet, view
    allowances, revoke successfully, see risk warnings). *Deliverable:*
    Documented acceptance test scripts for use in Week 3 testing.
    *Success Criteria:* The acceptance tests cover both functional and
    UX clarity aspects (e.g. includes "User should immediately see
    confirmation of revocation (feedback within
    100ms)[\[12\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=5,27)").
    These tests are dry-run internally to ensure they are realistic. Any
    user story that looks at risk of not meeting its acceptance criteria
    is flagged and addressed.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Support the frontend implementation by
    providing any missing assets (icons, illustrations) and doing quick
    UX reviews of what's built. Implement a **"Clarity audit"** of the
    implemented UI so far: check content for consistency, ensure empty
    states or error messages are in place where needed (no lorem ipsum
    or cryptic labels). Continue refining copy especially for new UI
    elements like error messages or tooltips explaining risk scores.
    *Deliverable:* Updated UX specifications as needed (e.g. a finalized
    icon set for risk levels, a style for alerts/notifications).
    *Success Criteria:* Frontend changes required are minimal -- meaning
    the developers implemented the designs correctly. A quick Blink Test
    on the working UI still passes (if not, iterate text or visuals
    now). All on-screen text has been reviewed for tone and reading
    level again post-implementation, making sure nothing regressed in
    clarity.

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** If a custom contract was created,
    deploy it to a testnet and integrate it with the backend/frontend.
    If using direct allowances revocation, integrate the web3 calls in
    the backend or frontend. Test the end-to-end revoke flow on testnet:
    user clicks revoke -\> transaction goes through -\> allowance is
    actually removed. *Deliverable:* Revoke functionality working in a
    test environment (smart contract deployed on Goerli or similar and
    called by the app). *Success Criteria:* In a test scenario, revoking
    an allowance updates the blockchain state (verified via Etherscan or
    reading the allowance again). The UI receives confirmation and
    updates the list (the revoked allowance disappears or shows as 0).
    Measured response: user sees feedback instantly on click (spinner or
    similar) and final confirmation within a few seconds. No security
    issues observed (e.g. the contract does not allow any unintended
    actions).

-   **Backend Lead:** Expand backend to a **fully functional API** for
    the MVP. This includes connecting the indexer to live data: for now,
    support Ethereum mainnet allowances for ERC-20 tokens (through a
    provider or API). Implement the revoke transaction endpoint if the
    frontend will call backend to orchestrate revokes (alternatively, if
    front-end calls blockchain directly, then backend focuses on data).
    Integrate the Risk Engine so that the `/allowances` endpoint returns
    risk assessments as well. *Deliverable:* Backend version 0.1
    deployed to a staging environment -- supports `GET /allowances` with
    real chain data and (if applicable) `POST /revoke` to initiate a
    revocation. *Success Criteria:* A full integration test (with a test
    wallet) shows that hitting the API yields actual allowances and risk
    flags. The system can process a revoke: risk data updates
    accordingly (e.g. risk score goes down after revoking a dangerous
    allowance). Load test: API can handle, say, 50 concurrent requests
    with acceptable latency (\< X ms overhead). All new code has unit
    tests and passes CI.

-   **Frontend Lead:** Connect the frontend to the live backend API.
    Replace placeholder data with real allowance data from the backend;
    display risk ratings clearly (e.g. red icon or "High Risk" label for
    dangerous allowances). Implement the **Revoke flow UI**: clicking
    revoke triggers the blockchain transaction (via Metamask or via
    backend) and the UI updates (disable button, show "revoking..."
    state, then show success or error message). Ensure to follow Pillar
    5 (Feedback) -- immediate feedback on
    action[\[12\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=5,27)and
    Pillar 4 (System status) -- show loading/error states clearly.
    *Deliverable:* A working MVP UI where a user can view and revoke
    token allowances on a connected wallet. *Success Criteria:*
    End-to-end test with a real wallet: user connects, sees actual
    allowances, and successfully revokes one. The primary UI flows meet
    clarity and usability: e.g. no ambiguous icons, every button has a
    label indicating its action, errors (like transaction failure) are
    displayed in plain language with guidance. Run an **automated
    Lighthouse audit** on the app: Performance \>90 and Accessibility
    100 (or any issues are trivial to
    fix)[\[13\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%20%20%20,90%20on%20performance%20audits)[\[14\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=AA%20success%20criteria%20,36%5D%2C%20though%20we%20avoid%20bragging).
    All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard (basic
    accessibility check).

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Set up **monitoring and logging** for the staging
    environment. Ensure that any errors in the backend (e.g. failed
    allowance fetch, API errors) are logged and can alert developers.
    Configure a basic uptime check. In CI, implement **continuous
    quality gates**: e.g. run Lighthouse for performance and
    accessibility budgets. Fail the build if budgets are not met (e.g.
    if LCP \> 2.5s or any Axe
    violations)[\[8\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=Core%20Web%20Vitals%20Budgets%3A%20As,Lighthouse%29%20and%20monitor)[\[14\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=AA%20success%20criteria%20,36%5D%2C%20though%20we%20avoid%20bragging).
    Also add a test to check that design tokens are used (e.g. no
    unauthorized CSS colors -- could use a stylelint rule to catch
    non-token colors to prevent contrast drift). *Deliverable:* Enhanced
    CI/CD with quality gate scripts (Lighthouse, Axe, style lint for
    tokens). Monitoring dashboard for staging (with logs and basic
    metrics like response times). *Success Criteria:* Any push that
    degrades core web vitals or accessibility now triggers CI fail
    (verified by intentionally introducing a minor issue in a test
    branch to see the gate catch it). The staging environment is stable
    and monitored -- no silent failures. DevOps can demonstrate an alert
    or log capture for a simulated failure (e.g. an API endpoint down).

-   **Security Researcher:** Begin security testing on the integrated
    MVP. Perform **penetration testing** on the staging app: test for
    OWASP Top 10 issues (XSS by injecting in input fields or malicious
    token data, checking that the backend properly authenticates the
    user's wallet address on any actions, etc.). Review how the app
    stores data (should be mostly ephemeral or public chain data; ensure
    no private keys or secrets in logs). If a smart contract is used,
    prepare for an audit: possibly engage an external auditor or do an
    in-depth internal code review now. *Deliverable:* Security test
    report for MVP, with any vulnerabilities or concerns listed.
    *Success Criteria:* All high-severity issues found are resolved or
    have a plan by end of week. Example: if a risky pattern is found
    (say, the backend trusts user-provided transaction data), developers
    fix it immediately. The system passes basic security hygiene: no
    admin backdoors, all secrets (API keys) are secure, and CORS/CSRF
    settings are properly configured for the web app.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Refine the risk engine with real data feedback.
    Analyze a sample of allowances from a few test wallets to see if the
    risk rules make sense (e.g. did it flag any known safe contract as
    high risk erroneously? Adjust thresholds accordingly). Also,
    implement telemetry capture for user interactions to feed future
    improvements: e.g. log an event whenever a user actually revokes an
    allowance that was rated high risk (this can later inform false
    positives/negatives). *Deliverable:* Updated risk scoring logic
    (v1.1) and a basic telemetry logging module integrated into backend
    or frontend for key events (with Privacy reviewed). *Success
    Criteria:* Risk labels align better with expectations after tuning
    (confirmed by Security/PO). Telemetry events are flowing for
    critical actions (verified in logs or a dev analytics dashboard).
    For instance, see events like `allowance_viewed` or
    `allowance_revoked` with context. Data schema includes no personal
    info beyond wallet and necessary metadata, respecting compliance.

-   **Growth Marketer:** Prepare for a **closed beta** announcement.
    Identify a small group of friendly users (perhaps those who signed
    up early or internal team) to try the MVP next week. Create
    onboarding materials for beta testers: simple instructions on how to
    connect wallet, what to expect, and how to provide feedback.
    Emphasize that this is early access, seeking their input.
    *Deliverable:* Beta outreach email/content drafted and ready to send
    in Week 3. *Success Criteria:* Beta list confirmed (names or
    addresses of testers ready). Onboarding content is reviewed by UX
    Writer to ensure it's extremely clear (no assumptions about user
    knowledge -- explain terms if needed). Beta users are briefed about
    the clarity-first design approach and asked to specifically note if
    anything is confusing.

-   **Support Lead:** Get hands-on with the MVP to prepare support. Use
    the staging app with a test wallet and intentionally simulate common
    issues (e.g. what if the user has no allowances -- is there an empty
    state message? What if the revoke transaction fails -- what does the
    error say?). Ensure support content covers these cases. Finalize the
    **Knowledge Base article** for MVP: step-by-step with screenshots on
    how to revoke an allowance using our app. *Deliverable:* Support
    FAQ/Guide v1 published internally (and ready for beta testers).
    *Success Criteria:* The support guide is tested: a non-team member
    should be able to follow it to use the app successfully. All
    screenshots are up to date with the current UI. Support is ready
    with a list of known issues or limitations to communicate to users
    (so there are no surprises). Any confusing UI elements identified
    are fed back to the team as actionable items.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Review the MVP implementation for any
    compliance red flags. For example, ensure that if we send any user
    data (like an email for alerts), proper consent is obtained in the
    UI. Verify that the Privacy Policy covers the telemetry events now
    being logged. If the beta involves users, create a **Beta Tester
    Agreement** (if needed) to protect the company (non-disclosure or at
    least stating that it's beta software without warranties).
    *Deliverable:* Compliance review memo of the MVP. *Success
    Criteria:* All data usage is compliant: e.g. if using Google
    Analytics or similar for telemetry, privacy mitigations (IP
    anonymization, etc.) are in place. Beta agreement (or updated ToS)
    is ready and has been approved by legal and communicated to Product
    Owner. No outstanding legal blockers for expanding usage in beta.

## Week 3 -- Risk Engine Enhancement & Clarity QA

-   **Architect:** This week focus on ensuring **scalability and
    resilience** of the core architecture now that all parts are
    connected. Review how the indexer will scale with more users (do we
    need caching? pagination for allowances list?), and how the alert
    pipeline will plug in next. Adjust any component interfaces if
    needed for upcoming features (like ensure the indexer can trigger
    events the alert system will use). *Deliverable:* Architecture
    addendum covering any changes (e.g. added caching layer, message
    queue for alerts). *Success Criteria:* A brief architecture review
    with Backend and Data leads confirms the system can handle e.g. 1000
    users polling allowances without crashing or rate-limiting issues.
    Future integration points (like the alert service) are accounted for
    so implementation can start smoothly next week.

-   **Product Owner:** Organize a **UX Clarity review** of the
    near-final MVP with team and a few outsiders (if available). Conduct
    the Blink Test and 5-Year-Old Test on the current app: gather
    feedback if any screen or terminology is confusing. Based on this,
    update the product requirements or backlog with any must-fix clarity
    issues (e.g. "Users didn't understand the risk score label -- need a
    tooltip explanation"). Also finalize the scope for Weeks 4--5 (alert
    feature and Time Machine), writing those user stories in detail now.
    *Deliverable:* Feedback report from clarity tests and updated
    backlog entries for issues. *Success Criteria:* All critical UX
    clarity issues are identified and have an owner/task to fix.
    Stakeholders agree the remaining timeline (alerts, simulation) is
    feasible. Any changes to requirements (from beta feedback or clarity
    tests) are incorporated without expanding scope beyond what Week 5
    can handle.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Tackle any **clarity gaps** found. If users
    struggled with terminology or layout, iterate designs accordingly
    (e.g. add an infographic or improve an icon). Design the
    **Alert/Notification UI**: how users will be informed of risky
    allowances (e.g. a banner, an email template, an in-app
    notification). Also start conceptual work for the **Time Machine**
    feature: wireframe how a user would simulate revoking allowances
    (maybe a toggle next to each allowance to "simulate removal" and a
    dashboard change indicating the difference). Ensure these new
    screens follow the clarity pillars (e.g. Time Machine screen must
    clearly show it's hypothetical, maybe a distinct color or label
    "Simulation Mode"). *Deliverable:* Revised UI designs for any
    adjusted components (risk info tooltip, etc.), and new design
    artifacts for Alerts and Time Machine features. *Success Criteria:*
    Team reviews the new designs and finds them immediately
    understandable. The Alert design conveys urgency without alarmism
    (clear messaging of what happened and what to do). The Time Machine
    wireflow is vetted with a quick internal test (explain the concept
    to a team member; if they grasp it quickly, it's on track). All
    designs continue to meet contrast/accessibility needs (checked in
    Figma for color use and font size).

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** If the product will include automated
    alerts or actions via a contract (for example, a potential future
    feature might be an on-chain registry of malicious contracts),
    consider if any additional on-chain components are needed now.
    Possibly not for v2.0; so focus on optimizing and finalizing the
    existing contract or scripts: perform a **gas optimization pass**
    and ensure compliance with any audit feedback (if preliminary audit
    results came in). *Deliverable:* Finalized smart contract code (if
    any) ready for audit or mainnet deployment in coming weeks. *Success
    Criteria:* Gas use per revoke is minimal (document any improvements
    made). All tests still pass. Audit (internal or external) of the
    contract yields no new findings, or all findings are resolved. The
    contract is tagged as release-candidate.

-   **Backend Lead:** Build the backbone of the **Alert Pipeline**. This
    could be a scheduler or service that periodically checks for changes
    in a user's allowances or new risk events. Implement logic to detect
    when a user gains a new high-risk allowance or when a contract is
    identified as malicious (triggering an alert). Start with in-app
    notifications: e.g. store alert events in a DB table associated with
    a user/wallet. Also provide an API endpoint for the frontend to
    fetch alerts. *Deliverable:* Alert service running in staging (could
    be a cron job or background worker in the backend) and `/alerts` API
    endpoint. *Success Criteria:* Simulate an alert scenario: e.g.,
    manually mark a test allowance as malicious, run the alert job, and
    verify an alert entry is created. The frontend (or a simple curl)
    can retrieve this alert. Ensure the pipeline won't spam: alerts are
    deduplicated or rate-limited properly. Code is covered by tests
    (simulate conditions for alert triggering). Architecture is
    consulted to ensure this fits (e.g. if high volume, consider using a
    queue like AWS SQS or Redis for events).

-   **Frontend Lead:** Implement UI improvements from clarity feedback.
    Add any new UI elements needed: for example, a tooltip or "Learn
    more" link on risk scores that opens an explanation modal (written
    by UX Writer). Ensure all interactive components have proper
    accessible labels (ARIA labels for icons, etc.). Begin integrating
    the **Alerts UI**: e.g. a notification icon showing the count of new
    alerts, an alerts dropdown or page showing alert messages with
    timestamps and actions (like "Revoke now" if applicable). Keep the
    design consistent with brand and clarity (e.g. alert messages use
    the tone guidelines: straightforward, not overly technical or
    panic-inducing). *Deliverable:* Updated frontend with clarity fixes
    and initial alert UI components (behind a feature flag if not fully
    functional yet). *Success Criteria:* UI passes regression tests (no
    new issues introduced). Spot-check the clarity fixes: if risk
    tooltip added, test with a new user if it clarifies the concept. The
    alerts icon and page are implemented in accordance with design, even
    if the data is dummy at first. All new UI elements meet
    accessibility standards (e.g. alerts have ARIA roles for screen
    readers, focus management if it's a modal, etc.).

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Integrate **Telemetry and Monitoring** for clarity
    and performance. By now, deploy an analytics/telemetry solution
    (could be self-hosted or a SaaS) to collect the custom events
    defined by Data/UX (like `ux.clarity_sample.v1` events that track
    glance time, error rates, etc.). Ensure these events are being
    recorded in staging when testers use the app. Also set up tracking
    for Core Web Vitals in the real environment (Real User Monitoring if
    available, or at least log CLS, LCP from the browser if possible).
    *Deliverable:* Telemetry dashboard or logs showing key UX metrics
    (e.g. an internal dashboard where we see events with
    `reading_grade_level` or `error_rate` as in PuredgeOS
    spec[\[15\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=These%20mappings%20are%20documented%20and,0.02)).
    *Success Criteria:* You can demonstrate a captured telemetry sample
    from a test session (e.g. it shows a sample event with
    `glanceability_ms` or similar). Alerts in monitoring are set if
    critical metrics deviate (e.g. error rate spikes above
    2%[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20)
    or API error count beyond a threshold). The system is ready to
    measure our success criteria in practice.

-   **Security Researcher:** Validate the **risk data sources** and
    alert logic from a security standpoint. Ensure that the sources for
    malicious addresses or threat intel are credible and up-to-date (if
    using an external feed, verify integration). Check that the alert
    pipeline cannot be abused (e.g. an attacker shouldn't be able to
    spam fake alerts by manipulating input data). Work with Data Lead to
    design any additional monitoring for security events (like alert if
    a single wallet is getting a flood of new approvals - could indicate
    a compromise). *Deliverable:* Security assessment report of the new
    risk/alert components. *Success Criteria:* The risk engine does not
    falsely classify obvious safe contracts (keeping false positives low
    to maintain credibility). The alert system has safeguards (e.g. will
    not repeatedly send the same alert without user action, etc.). Any
    new potential abuse vectors (like spamming our system with fake
    data) are documented and mitigated. Security gives a provisional OK
    for turning on alerts for beta users.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Expand the risk analysis with deeper data. If
    possible, integrate an API or dataset for contract reputation (e.g.
    fetch data from Etherscan's labels or a crowdsourced database to
    mark known scams). Improve the risk scoring model with this data:
    e.g. if a contract address is flagged by external sources,
    automatically High risk. Also implement the logic for the **Time
    Machine simulation** on the back end: essentially, a function that
    takes a hypothetical "revoke these allowances" and recomputes the
    overall risk profile or token exposure. This might just reuse the
    risk engine but excluding certain allowances. *Deliverable:* Risk
    engine v2 with external data integration and a backend function for
    simulating allowance removal (could be an endpoint or internal
    module ready to be used by front-end). *Success Criteria:* Unit
    tests for risk scoring show improved detection (e.g. a known
    malicious address now correctly yields High risk). External data is
    cached or stored to avoid performance hits. The simulation function
    returns correct adjusted risk outcomes in tests (e.g., if you remove
    all high-risk allowances in input, the resulting risk score drops to
    Low). Data quality is maintained (no unstable external calls in
    critical path -- use fallback or timeouts properly).

-   **Growth Marketer:** Engage the **beta testers** this week. Send out
    beta invites and manage the communication channel (e.g. a private
    Discord or email thread for feedback). Collect qualitative feedback
    especially on first impressions ("Was it clear what to do on the
    dashboard? Did you understand the risk rating?"). Provide testers a
    quick survey focusing on clarity and perceived value. *Deliverable:*
    Beta test feedback and engagement summary by end of week. *Success
    Criteria:* At least (for example) 5-10 beta users have used the app
    and provided feedback. The feedback is documented and shared with
    the team. Key insights (especially any clarity issues or bugs) are
    turned into actionable tasks in the backlog. Positive indicators
    (e.g. testers were able to use the tool without live support, which
    implies good UX) are noted as well.

-   **Support Lead:** Support the beta testers actively. Be on standby
    to answer questions from beta users (and note what questions come up
    most). Use this as a dry run for launch support: track response
    times, satisfaction of beta users. Update the Knowledge Base or FAQs
    with any new questions encountered (e.g. "What does simulation mode
    mean?" if Time Machine is being discussed, etc.). *Deliverable:* Log
    of support interactions during beta and updated FAQ. *Success
    Criteria:* Beta users' questions are resolved quickly (target
    initial response within a few hours). No critical question goes
    unanswered. The FAQ is refined such that new users at launch could
    self-serve for those same questions. The support process (ticket
    system or chat) is tested and working smoothly.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Evaluate any user feedback for compliance
    issues. For example, if beta users suggest features like email
    notifications, ensure that we have consent to send emails (opt-in).
    Double-check that all beta participants agreed to required terms (if
    a Beta Agreement was used, make sure all returned it signed or
    clicked-through). Also verify the product does not inadvertently
    stray into regulated territory (for instance, if we label something
    as "High Risk", ensure disclaimers that it\'s an opinion, not
    financial advice). *Deliverable:* Compliance sign-off for moving
    from beta to launch. *Success Criteria:* Legal is comfortable that
    the current state has no new legal issues. All beta participants
    properly covered under terms. Any adjustments needed (like adding a
    disclaimer line in the UI for risk scores) are communicated and put
    into the backlog for Week 4 if critical.

## Week 4 -- Alerts & Beta Refinement

-   **Architect:** Conduct a comprehensive **system review** now that
    alerts and core features are implemented. Verify inter-service
    communication (if alert service is separate, ensure it integrates
    correctly with main backend and database). Plan for any **load
    increase** with alerts: for example, if we send email/push
    notifications in the future, ensure architecture can plug that in
    (maybe use a message queue or external service). *Deliverable:*
    System architecture v1.0 finalized -- includes alerts component and
    any necessary infrastructure (e.g. cron jobs, queues) documented.
    *Success Criteria:* The architecture is ready for launch: all
    components are in place on paper and reviewed against our
    non-functional requirements (scalability, fault tolerance).
    Architect signs off that no further structural changes are needed
    pre-launch, only tuning.

-   **Product Owner:** Prepare for the **public launch** scope. Triage
    any remaining issues from beta feedback and clarity reviews: mark
    which must be resolved in Weeks 4--5 and which can wait for
    post-launch (maintain the "ruthless clarity" rule -- nothing
    confusing goes live, even if it means dropping a minor feature).
    Kick off a **go/no-go checklist** for launch readiness: performance
    metrics within targets, accessibility audit passed, legal approvals,
    support content ready, etc. *Deliverable:* Launch readiness
    checklist document with owners and status for each item. *Success
    Criteria:* By end of Week 4, the checklist shows no major gaps for a
    launch at Week 7/8. If any launch blocker exists (e.g. accessibility
    issue, security hole), it's highlighted and has an owner and
    deadline. Team is aligned in a go/no-go meeting that we are on track
    or if not, what must change.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Finalize all UI/UX details for launch. This
    includes polishing visual details (consistent spacing, alignment,
    responsive behavior on mobile). Run a full **accessibility audit**
    on the UI (using screen reader testing, high contrast mode, etc.)
    and create a list of any required tweaks (like alt text for icons,
    focus order adjustments). Create the content for **empty states**
    and edge cases discovered in beta (e.g. if a user has no allowances
    or all low risk, show a reassuring message). Also design a small
    "success state" animation or confirmation for when a user revokes an
    allowance (something subtle that delights but doesn't distract,
    aligned with our Immersion second rule). *Deliverable:* UI/UX polish
    changes delivered to Frontend (final Figma updates or direct
    contributions if working with code CSS). *Success Criteria:* A
    thorough UX review finds no lingering issues: visual polish is at
    "pixel-perfect" level, and the app meets WCAG 2.2 AA+ standards
    (verified by audit results, e.g. all text is resizable, all
    interactive elements have focus states, etc.). The revocation
    success feedback is implemented in design and is satisfying (and
    tested to not slow down the UX). The clarity of every screen is
    re-validated post-polish (no new copy or design element reintroduced
    confusion).

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** If the contract has passed audits and
    testing, deploy the **production smart contract** (if applicable) to
    mainnet or prepare it for use. Generate the contract address and
    share with the team. Write a short **deployment report** and usage
    guidelines (so front-end knows the address/ABI if needed, backend
    knows any configuration). If no contract, ensure the transaction
    integration (via ethers.js, etc.) is configured for mainnet use.
    *Deliverable:* Smart contract deployed (if needed) and integrated;
    documentation of the contract's functions and addresses in the repo.
    *Success Criteria:* A test transaction on mainnet (or mainnet fork)
    using the final contract works successfully from the app. The
    contract is verified on Etherscan (for transparency) if it\'s
    public. Security researcher gives a final thumbs-up that the
    on-chain component is safe for production use. For non-contract
    approach: final dry-run of revocation on mainnet with a team wallet
    confirms the process works and is safe.

-   **Backend Lead:** Finalize the **Alert delivery mechanism**. If we
    plan to send emails or push notifications for alerts at launch,
    integrate with an email service or Web3 notification service (like
    EPNS). Ensure that sending is done asynchronously to not slow the
    app. Alternatively, if launch scope is only in-app alerts, make sure
    the alert list in the app updates in real-time (perhaps via polling
    or webhooks). Also, perform a final **performance tuning** on the
    backend: optimize any slow DB queries, enable caching for frequent
    reads (like if multiple users query the same token data), and verify
    memory/CPU usage under load. *Deliverable:* Production-ready backend
    v1.0, with alert system complete and performance optimizations
    applied. *Success Criteria:* Load test results meet our goals (e.g.
    p95 API latency under 500ms at expected load, as per performance
    budgets). Alerts can be delivered to users reliably (tested by
    simulating a new alert and observing an email or in-app
    notification). No critical bugs remain in backend (run integration
    tests suite -- all green).

-   **Frontend Lead:** Implement **Time Machine (Simulation) feature**
    on the UI now that backend logic is ready. Add a mode or panel where
    a user can toggle allowances as "revoked" hypothetically and
    immediately see the outcome (e.g. updated total risk score or an
    indicator "Risk after simulation"). Ensure it\'s clearly labeled as
    a simulation so as not to confuse real state. Work with Data Lead to
    present the simulation results in an understandable way (e.g. "Your
    overall exposure would drop from High to Low if you revoke these 3
    allowances"). Also finish integrating any remaining alert UI with
    live data from backend. *Deliverable:* Updated front-end with Time
    Machine feature functional and alert notifications live. *Success
    Criteria:* In staging, a user can enter simulation mode, select some
    allowances to "remove," and see the updated risk assessment; exiting
    simulation returns to actual state seamlessly. Telemetry event
    `ux.sim_diff.v1` is fired each time a user runs a simulation
    scenario (with relevant properties like count of allowances
    simulated) to track usage. The feature passes clarity tests (a test
    user understands that it's a hypothetical tool, not actually
    revoking at that moment). Additionally, the alert UI now shows real
    alerts from the backend -- tested by simulating an alert trigger.
    All new UI code continues to pass performance budgets (no
    significant bundle size increase that slows LCP).

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Harden the production pipeline. Set up continuous
    deployment for the app, with proper **versioning and rollback**
    procedures. Ensure that the CI/CD will prevent deployment if any
    quality gate fails at this late stage (we maintain zero tolerance
    for accessibility failures or performance regressions). Implement
    final **infrastructure as code** for production (terraform or
    scripts for spinning up servers, databases, etc.). Conduct a **load
    and stress test** simulating peak usage (maybe using test scripts or
    a small load generator) to catch any scaling bottlenecks.
    *Deliverable:* Production environment ready (all services deployed
    with correct config), and a load test report. *Success Criteria:*
    The app remains stable under heavy load (for example, 2x expected
    traffic) with no crashes and within performance limits (e.g.
    CPU/memory within thresholds, response times acceptable). CI/CD
    pipeline is configured to deploy only on passing tests and to alert
    if a deploy fails. We have a rollback strategy tested (e.g.
    deploying a bad version in staging and rolling back smoothly). All
    environment variables and secrets for production are securely stored
    and accessible to the app.

-   **Security Researcher:** Perform a **final full security audit** of
    the entire system. This includes reviewing any changes made in the
    last sprint (Time Machine, alerts) for security implications,
    running another round of penetration tests focusing on new surfaces,
    and verifying all previous fixes. Ensure compliance with security
    best practices: e.g. Content Security Policy on the web app is set,
    secure cookies, API endpoints have proper
    authentication/authorization (in our case, likely ensuring one user
    cannot fetch another's alerts, etc.). Possibly engage an external
    security firm for a quick scan or bug bounty pre-launch if time
    permits. *Deliverable:* Final security audit report with sign-off.
    *Success Criteria:* All critical and high issues are closed.
    Medium/low issues are documented with owners for post-launch if
    needed but none are showstoppers. The team has a security incident
    response plan (just in case, how to revoke a compromised key or
    handle a vulnerability post-launch). The product is deemed "secure
    enough to launch" by the security team.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Final calibration of risk model using beta test
    data and any new intelligence. If any beta user had a surprise (like
    an unflagged malicious allowance), update the model/rules to cover
    that. Ensure the telemetry is capturing useful data for post-launch
    analysis (e.g. distribution of risk levels among users, number of
    revokes done, etc.). Work on a plan for **ML improvements
    post-launch** (if applicable), such as anomaly detection on
    allowance patterns, but mark this beyond current 60-day scope.
    *Deliverable:* Risk engine final version (v2.0) locked for launch,
    with documentation of how risk is calculated for transparency (could
    be internal documentation or even a help article). *Success
    Criteria:* Risk categorization is accurate and stable: tests and
    manual review show it catches obvious bad cases and doesn't cry wolf
    on safe cases. Data pipelines (indexer, telemetry) are all running
    without error. The team has a clear understanding from Data Lead of
    what metrics will be tracked post-launch to measure success (e.g.
    average risk reduction after using the product, etc.).

-   **Growth Marketer:** Ramp up **launch marketing** efforts. Prepare
    blog posts, press releases or Twitter threads announcing Allowance
    Guard 2.0's launch. Highlight key features (approval revocations,
    risk scoring, alerts, simulation) with an emphasis on user benefits
    and clarity ("Know exactly what's in your wallet, and take action
    with confidence"). Coordinate with any partners (maybe wallets or
    security firms) to co-promote if possible. Also plan some initial
    growth experiments for post-launch (like maybe an in-app prompt
    "Share with a friend" to drive referrals, though that might be a
    future thing). *Deliverable:* All launch content ready and scheduled
    for Week 7 (announcements, articles, etc.), and the marketing site
    updated with latest screenshots and messaging. *Success Criteria:*
    Internal stakeholders review and approve all marketing content
    (accurate and clear). Metrics goals are set (e.g. target number of
    users or allowances revoked in first week) to measure launch
    success. The brand presentation in marketing aligns with PuredgeOS
    guidelines (polished, confident, and clear --- no contradictory
    messaging or misleading claims).

-   **Support Lead:** Finalize support preparations for launch. Complete
    a **Support Runbook** that contains common issues and
    troubleshooting steps so any support team member can quickly assist
    users. Ensure the support channels are staffed around launch time
    (if expecting influx of inquiries). Conduct one more round of using
    the app as if a user and intentionally breaking things to see what
    kind of support tickets might arise (e.g. what if a transaction is
    pending for a long time? what message do we give and does support
    need to intervene or advise patience?). *Deliverable:* Support
    Runbook and an updated FAQ published on the website or help center
    for launch. *Success Criteria:* Support staff (even if just one or
    two people) have been through training on the product. They can
    answer likely questions confidently. The help center/FAQ is live and
    easily accessible from the app. During a mock support scenario, the
    support lead could handle it using the documentation alone (proving
    its usefulness).

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Give final approval on all user-facing
    aspects. Review the final UI text for any legal compliance (e.g.
    ensure we don't use phrases that guarantee safety -- better to say
    "helps you reduce risk" not "eliminate risk"). Make sure terms and
    privacy links are in the app (usually in the footer or about
    section). If sending emails or notifications, confirm we include
    unsubscribe options and necessary legal footers. *Deliverable:*
    Legal sign-off memo that everything is in order for launch (or a
    checklist of minor items to tweak with owners). *Success Criteria:*
    The legal team explicitly okays the launch. All policies are
    accessible to users at launch. No outstanding compliance issues
    (like missing user consent for something). The product abides by all
    relevant laws (privacy, data, etc.) as far as Legal can determine.

## Week 5 -- Advanced Features & Telemetry Completion

*(Accelerated timeline note: If the team is ahead and core features are
rock-solid by end of Week 4, some launch activities could be pulled
earlier. However, Week 5 is planned for feature enhancement and polish
to ensure a top-quality release.)*

-   **Architect:** Support the implementation of advanced features (Time
    Machine) by ensuring the architecture can handle these in a modular
    way. Review how the simulation feature was integrated -- it should
    be isolated enough not to affect live data integrity. Ensure that
    adding this feature did not introduce undue complexity or technical
    debt. If any corners were cut earlier to meet deadlines, identify
    them now and assign refactoring tasks (especially anything that
    could compromise clarity or performance). *Deliverable:* List of any
    technical debt or clarity debt items discovered and plan to address
    them (either this week or post-launch). *Success Criteria:* No
    architectural compromise is left unacknowledged. For example, if the
    indexer's current design won't scale beyond Ethereum (single chain),
    it\'s documented for future fix but not critical for launch. The
    Time Machine integration is verified to not break the single source
    of truth (e.g. simulation runs client-side or in an isolated
    context, not altering actual DB records). Team confidence remains
    high in system integrity.

-   **Product Owner:** Conduct a **full end-to-end acceptance test**
    this week for all features including alerts and simulation. Simulate
    a user journey: onboard -\> connect wallet -\> review allowances -\>
    revoke something -\> get an alert (if applicable) -\> use Time
    Machine to simulate improvements. Note any friction or delays.
    Update user stories acceptance criteria if new edge cases were
    discovered (e.g. "if user has already revoked all allowances, the
    Time Machine feature should be hidden"). Lock down the final scope:
    anything not done by end of Week 5 is moved out of the launch scope
    to avoid last-minute chaos. *Deliverable:* Signed-off UAT (User
    Acceptance Testing) report. *Success Criteria:* All tests in the UAT
    pass or have trivial issues. Any blocker found during UAT is
    addressed immediately by the team and re-tested. The Product Owner
    declares the product meets the Definition of Done for launch
    features (pending final bugfixes). Everyone knows exactly what will
    be delivered at launch, and there is no remaining ambiguity in
    expected behavior.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Perform a last **content clarity sweep** and
    finalize the UX copy. Double-check every piece of text in the app:
    tooltips, error messages, settings, etc., for adherence to
    voice/tone and simplicity. If needed, run a final reading level
    analysis on all user-facing text and adjust phrasing to meet \~8th
    grade level
    target[\[4\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=until%20needed%29,and%20check%20if%20it%20stays).
    Also ensure consistency: e.g. if we capitalized "Allowance" in one
    place, do it everywhere; if the risk levels are "High/Medium/Low"
    ensure those are defined and used uniformly. Prepare any
    **microcopy** for notifications or emails (like the content of an
    alert email, if that's being launched). *Deliverable:* Final copy
    deck and content guidelines (a brief document listing terminology
    and style decisions for reference). *Success Criteria:* No copy in
    the app is above the intended reading difficulty (verify with a
    tool). Internally, team members from different backgrounds can read
    through the app and find nothing confusing or off-brand. The clarity
    pillars with respect to Information and Emotion (Pillars 7 and 8)
    are fully met: content is concise and users feel confident and
    informed[\[16\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=information%20needed%20at%20that%20moment%2C,could%20indicate%20missing%20info)[\[17\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=8,34).

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** Not much new development at this stage;
    focus on supporting testing and any final fixes. Ensure the contract
    (if used) has enough **ETH for gas** if it's a relayer (likely not,
    since user pays with their wallet). If no contract, verify that the
    application properly handles the mainnet chain IDs, gas price
    suggestions, etc., for smooth operation. Write a simple **runbook
    for contract emergencies** (e.g. if an issue is discovered with the
    contract after launch, how to disable or update it -- maybe via a
    feature flag to switch to direct revocation calls). *Deliverable:*
    Smart contract section in the Ops runbook (or a brief note on how to
    handle contract issues). *Success Criteria:* Team is prepared for
    the scenario where something on-chain might go wrong -- this
    contingency planning is acknowledged and a process is in place (like
    "in worst case, push an update to route revocations directly without
    contract usage"). No further changes needed in contract code, as
    confirmed by final tests (the contract behaves correctly on mainnet
    in a dry run).

-   **Backend Lead:** Complete any remaining **bug fixes or
    optimizations** from Week 4 testing. This likely includes tightening
    security (e.g. ensure API only serves data for the user's own wallet
    -- perhaps using wallet authentication via signature if not already)
    and optimizing the simulation endpoint if it was slow. Double-check
    that all backend endpoints have proper input validation and error
    handling so that no unhandled exceptions occur (stability). Also, if
    any features were toggled off for beta (like multi-chain support),
    ensure config flags are correctly set for launch (maybe we only
    support Ethereum at launch, with others off). *Deliverable:* Backend
    code freeze by end of this week -- final build ready. *Success
    Criteria:* A final regression test on backend passes (all
    unit/integration tests green, and a simulated production run yields
    expected results). Memory and CPU profiling shows no memory leaks or
    obvious inefficiencies. The backend is containerized and ready to
    deploy in production configuration. All logs have been sanitized (no
    sensitive info) and logging level is appropriate for production
    (info level with necessary details, debug off).

-   **Frontend Lead:** This week is about **performance tuning and final
    QA** for the frontend. Perform tree-shaking and bundle analysis to
    remove any unused dependencies, ensure code splitting is effective
    (so that less-critical pages load later or on demand). Test the app
    on multiple devices and browsers for responsiveness and performance.
    Achieve all Core Web Vitals in green for the demo user journeys
    (target LCP ≤1.8s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200ms in lab
    tests)[\[8\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=Core%20Web%20Vitals%20Budgets%3A%20As,Lighthouse%29%20and%20monitor).
    Fix any last-minute UI bugs (like misaligned elements, incorrect
    z-index, etc.). Also implement any final telemetry events that were
    pending (for example, ensure a `ux.clarity_sample` event fires on
    key pages capturing reading_grade_level, contrast, etc., as
    defined[\[15\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=These%20mappings%20are%20documented%20and,0.02)).
    *Deliverable:* Optimized production build of the frontend. *Success
    Criteria:* Lighthouse score on the production build: Performance \>
    90, Accessibility 100, Best Practices/Security 100, SEO \> 90. Core
    Web Vitals thresholds met in tests (and instrumentation in place to
    measure them in real usage). The app feels "instant" -- interactions
    have no noticeable lag (checked via the Speed Test \<100ms
    interactions[\[3\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=The%205,immediately%20clear%2C%20deeply%20engaging%2C%20and)).
    QA passes on all target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile
    devices). All telemetry events are firing and visible in the
    analytics system, including the clarity metrics and simulation usage
    events.

-   **DevOps/SRE:** This week, run the **final rehearsals for launch**.
    Execute a staged deployment in a production-like environment, then
    perform a rollback to ensure the procedure works. Double-check all
    monitoring alerts are tuned (no false alarms, but also nothing
    missing --- e.g., simulate a down service to see if an alert
    triggers). Ensure the backup schedules are in place for any
    databases. Importantly, set up **analytics monitoring** to feed
    UX/product: e.g. create a daily report query that will show key
    metrics (number of active users, number of revokes, average time on
    page, any errors). Work with Data Lead on this if needed.
    *Deliverable:* Deployment and monitoring checklist completed;
    analytics reporting established. *Success Criteria:* Everyone is
    confident in the deployment process after dry-run (no one is
    deploying untested on launch day). If any part fails, it's
    documented and fixed. Monitoring is so thorough that any significant
    anomaly in prod (traffic spike, error spike, latency issue) will
    ping the team immediately. The system is effectively on autopilot
    for launch with the team on standby only for truly unexpected
    events.

-   **Security Researcher:** Do a **final sweep for vulnerabilities**:
    re-run dependency scans (ensure no libraries with known CVEs),
    ensure all third-party services (if any) are properly secured (API
    keys not exposed, etc.). If a bug bounty or responsible disclosure
    program will be announced at launch, prepare the process for that
    (how will we receive and respond to reports). Also, verify one last
    time that user data is safe: e.g. telemetry or logs aren't
    inadvertently storing personal information like IP addresses without
    need (and if they are, ensure Privacy Policy covers it or remove
    it). *Deliverable:* Security closure report stating all known issues
    have been addressed. *Success Criteria:* The product passes a
    "security gate" -- for example, run an automated security scan or
    lint (like npm audit, Snyk) and get zero high-severity issues. A
    test penetration attempt by the security team now yields no new
    findings. The team has contacts and procedures in place should any
    security issue arise post-launch (so we can react within 24 hours).
    Compliance-wise, security confirms that we meet any obligations
    (e.g. if handling user email, we store it encrypted or only in
    trusted services).

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Archive and reset any necessary data for a clean
    launch. For instance, if the indexer DB has test data or beta user
    data, decide whether to wipe or keep it. If keeping, ensure data
    correctness. Finalize the **metrics tracking plan**: what specific
    KPIs will we measure at launch? Likely candidates: number of
    allowances scanned, number of revokes performed, percentage of users
    who revoked at least one high-risk allowance, average risk reduction
    per user, etc. Ensure the telemetry and analytics can yield these
    numbers. Communicate these to Product Owner/Growth so they know what
    to look for. *Deliverable:* Data/Analytics readiness confirmation.
    *Success Criteria:* On launch day, we will be able to get initial
    metrics without code changes. Data pipelines (for both blockchain
    data and telemetry) are fully operational and robust (tested by
    simulating a day's use and verifying data integrity). If any ML
    model training is planned post-launch (perhaps to improve risk
    scoring), the groundwork is laid (data is being collected
    appropriately for training, with user privacy in mind). For now, ML
    is kept minimal in production to avoid unpredictability.

-   **Growth Marketer:** Start the **soft launch** communications if
    any. Perhaps invite a broader set of users from the waitlist to join
    in Week 6 (controlled ramp-up) to further test scalability and
    gather testimonials. Finalize all PR materials and coordinate launch
    events (AMA, Twitter Space, etc., if planned). Ensure that **app
    store listings** or similar (if this was mobile, but here it's web)
    are prepared if needed. Also set up tools to track growth funnels
    from day 1 (how users find us, where they drop off). *Deliverable:*
    Growth plan for launch week (who is doing what on social, any paid
    promotions ready). *Success Criteria:* Everything is scheduled and
    nothing is last-minute. The team knows what the public messaging
    will be. All tracking URLs or campaign codes are ready so that when
    traffic comes, we can attribute it. Early access users from waitlist
    are onboarded successfully in this soft launch with no major issues,
    building confidence for the full public announcement.

-   **Support Lead:** Do a **mock launch-day support drill**. Assume
    launch has happened: populate the support queue with a few
    hypothetical issues (one user can't connect wallet, one sees a weird
    error, one is just praising the app, etc.) and walk through
    responding to them using prepared resources. Fine-tune any support
    macros or saved replies in the helpdesk tool. Ensure the FAQ is
    up-to-date one last time (e.g. add any Q&A from the beta that might
    be relevant to new users). If multilingual support is in scope
    (likely not in 60 days, but if so, ensure at least a plan for
    language support or translation of key articles). *Deliverable:*
    Updated support SOP (standard operating procedures) that includes
    handling launch surge and escalating urgent issues (like if multiple
    users report the same bug, how to alert engineering quickly).
    *Success Criteria:* The support team feels ready and confident.
    There are no unanswered "what if" scenarios left. The average first
    response time and resolution time targets for launch are defined
    (even if informally) so support can strive to meet them. If any
    last-minute clarity issues are discovered via these drills (like an
    FAQ answer seems confusing), they are corrected now.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Final launch legal check. If any changes
    occurred in Week 4--5 (like new features Time Machine), ensure any
    legal implications are addressed (Time Machine might not have
    specific issues, but double-check it doesn't accidentally put the
    company in an advisory role -- likely fine). Confirm that any
    licenses for libraries or code are complied with (open source
    attribution if needed in an about screen or docs). Prepare a brief
    for the team on how to handle any legal inquiries that might come
    post-launch (e.g. if a user or journalist asks something about
    compliance or liability, what is our official stance).
    *Deliverable:* Green light email or meeting from Legal for launch.
    *Success Criteria:* All boxes checked: Terms of Service and Privacy
    Policy have been deployed on the website, any trademark or copyright
    considerations are handled (the name "Allowance Guard" is clear to
    use, etc.). Legal has peace of mind that nothing in the app will
    cause immediate legal trouble. The team is aware of any disclaimers
    that must be prominently displayed (and they are).

## Week 6 -- Final QA & Pre-Launch Go/No-Go

-   **Architect:** Participate in a final **Go/No-Go meeting** with all
    leads. Review each component's status (front-end, back-end, etc.)
    against the original architecture and quality goals. If any aspect
    is even slightly below the "God-tier" bar, discuss whether to fix
    immediately or delay launch. Architect's role is to be custodian of
    quality -- ensure no system flaws are being glossed over.
    *Deliverable:* Go/No-Go recommendation from architecture
    perspective. *Success Criteria:* The architecture is robust and
    meets all design goals (clarity, performance, security). If any
    compromise was made, it's clearly communicated and agreed as
    acceptable or temporary. The final sign-off is given from an
    engineering architecture stance to proceed to launch.

-   **Product Owner:** Formally decide on **Launch Go** if criteria are
    met. Use the checklist from Week 4, updated with latest QA results.
    All required success criteria must be green: e.g. usability metrics
    (testers \>90% task success, no critical UX issues open),
    performance metrics (CWV all
    green[\[13\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%20%20%20,90%20on%20performance%20audits)),
    security sign-off received, etc. If everything is "go", coordinate
    with Growth on the exact launch timing and with DevOps on the
    release date. If something is not meeting the standard, be ready to
    exercise the option to delay or use Week 7 as buffer (but
    communicate clearly to stakeholders). *Deliverable:* Launch decision
    and schedule. *Success Criteria:* **Go** for launch is declared
    because all quality gates are satisfied. (If not, the criteria for a
    No-Go are documented and a rapid plan is made to address them).
    Assuming Go: everyone on the team knows the launch date/hour and
    their role during launch (PO typically coordinates a war-room or
    slack channel for live monitoring).

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Double-check the live production (or
    production-simulated) environment UI for any anomalies. Sometimes
    things differ outside dev environments (fonts loading, CDN issues,
    etc.). Validate that the design integrity holds in the final build.
    Prepare a post-launch **UX monitoring plan**: e.g. set up Hotjar or
    similar (if allowed by privacy) for seeing user sessions or at least
    plan some user interviews after launch to gather UX feedback.
    *Deliverable:* Final UX sign-off and a plan for post-launch UX
    evaluation. *Success Criteria:* The designer is satisfied that the
    product as delivered meets the PuredgeOS "clarity and immersion"
    goals fully. The clarity pillars are all visibly adhered to -- e.g.
    they can point to each of the 10 pillars and show evidence in the
    product. Post-launch, we have a method to continue measuring UX
    (like tracking those clarity telemetry metrics and possibly direct
    user feedback channels).

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** During final pre-launch, focus on
    **monitoring the contract** if one is used. Set up Etherscan alerts
    or internal monitoring for the contract (like if any unusual
    activity or high error rate on transactions appears). Ensure the
    contract's source code is verified and published with docs for
    transparency to the community. If the contract has an admin (like
    upgradeability or pausing feature), double-check those keys and
    access (ideally multisig or locked to ensure no single point of
    failure). *Deliverable:* Contract monitoring/alert setup (could be
    Etherscan watch or custom script) and public verification. *Success
    Criteria:* The community or any advanced user can inspect the smart
    contract on Etherscan and see it matches exactly what we described
    (transparency builds trust). There are alerts that would notify the
    team if, say, someone interacts with the contract in an unexpected
    way (since it's not heavily used except via our app normally). The
    contract engineer is ready on standby during launch in case any
    on-chain issues arise (e.g. unexpected gas spike or network issue).

-   **Backend Lead:** Lock down the production database with real data.
    If needed, migrate any test data out and ensure fresh start or
    continuous from beta as planned. Make sure all environment toggles
    are correct (e.g. using mainnet endpoints, production API keys).
    Triple-check error logging in production mode (no stack traces
    leaking to users, but errors still log internally). Conduct a final
    backup of any critical data before launch (especially if carrying
    over beta data). *Deliverable:* Production backend deployed and
    idle, ready to accept traffic upon launch command. *Success
    Criteria:* Hitting the production API base URL shows a health-check
    or 200 OK (meaning all systems up). All connections to external
    dependencies (node providers, databases, email service) are
    confirmed working with a test ping. The backend lead has validated
    that scaling settings (auto-scale or number of instances, etc.) are
    set to handle initial user load. There is a clear rollback procedure
    if any issue (e.g. environment variable switch to maintenance mode,
    etc.).

-   **Frontend Lead:** Stage the final release build for the frontend.
    Ensure that the version is incremented and visible (for
    support/reference). Possibly implement a **feature flag** or toggle
    that allows disabling certain features quickly if needed (for
    example, if Time Machine is experimental, be ready to turn it off
    server-side or via config if it misbehaves under real load).
    Coordinate with DevOps to ensure the CDN or hosting is primed (maybe
    pre-cache some assets to avoid first-user slow loads).
    *Deliverable:* Final build ready and pushed to production
    CDN/servers (but maybe behind a feature flag or not publicly linked
    until launch moment). *Success Criteria:* The final smoke test on
    production front-end is flawless: the app loads quickly, all links
    and buttons function, and integration with prod backend is
    confirmed. The app is essentially live but not yet announced, and a
    few internal users test it quietly to ensure everything is indeed
    working in the production context. No last-minute cross-origin
    issues or config bugs.

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Execute **pre-launch checks** thoroughly. This
    includes security scanning the production environment (ensuring no
    ports open that shouldn't be, certificates are valid if using HTTPS,
    etc.), running final Lighthouse/Axe audits on the deployed product
    one more time and archiving those results as baseline. Prepare to
    scale up services as needed at launch (if using cloud auto-scaling,
    maybe pre-scale to avoid cold start latencies). Also, ensure that
    all team members have the access they need for launch (monitoring
    dashboards accounts, etc.) and that you have emergency access to all
    systems if something needs quick fixing. *Deliverable:* Pre-launch
    ops report (document listing each check done: security scan,
    performance baseline, infra ready, etc.). *Success Criteria:* All
    systems are green an hour before launch. If any monitoring alerts
    are going off, they are investigated and resolved. The team has a
    single communication channel for any issues and everyone knows who
    is on point for which area (DevOps on infrastructure, Frontend on UI
    bugs, etc.). Essentially, the SRE signs off that "Ops is a go."

-   **Security Researcher:** Stand by during launch as well for any
    incident, but at this point ensure the **responsible disclosure
    policy** is live (e.g. put a note in the footer "Security issues?
    Contact \..."). If a bug bounty program is part of launch, make sure
    it's published. Finally, ensure that any customer data handling has
    been documented for security compliance (like if later we need to do
    a SOC 2, we have notes on where data flows). *Deliverable:* Security
    & Privacy section for launch (maybe a page on site or a note in
    documentation outlining our security measures and how to report
    issues). *Success Criteria:* The company demonstrates transparency
    and proactiveness about security to users from day one. No stone
    left unturned in pre-launch: the Security Researcher is effectively
    bored at this point because everything is tight. If something does
    occur (e.g. a vulnerability found by a user), the process to handle
    it is ready.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Start live monitoring of data as soft launch may
    begin. Check the telemetry coming from any early users quietly on
    production: verify events are coming in and make sense (no PII,
    values in expected ranges). Ensure that the **alert rules** and risk
    engine are functioning with live data -- for example, maybe use a
    known test wallet with a high-risk allowance in production and see
    that an alert is generated. *Deliverable:* Initial data sanity
    report at launch time. *Success Criteria:* There are no surprises in
    the data: the number of allowances per user, distribution of risk
    ratings, etc., look reasonable and similar to what was seen in
    testing. If any metric looks off (e.g. suddenly many errors logged),
    it is caught immediately and addressed. The ML lead confirms that
    all telemetry needed to evaluate clarity and success is flowing, so
    by end of Week 7 we can produce a meaningful report on KPIs.

-   **Growth Marketer:** All systems go on the marketing side for launch
    next week (Week 7). Begin warming up the audience with a "T-minus 3
    days" tease (if applicable) to maintain excitement. Coordinate with
    any influencers or partners who will amplify the launch
    announcement. Ensure the website homepage is updated to remove
    "beta" or "coming soon" labels at launch moment. *Deliverable:*
    Final marketing assets loaded and scheduled (tweets, posts, emails).
    *Success Criteria:* We have a synchronized plan: e.g., at launch
    hour, the press release goes out, the blog post publishes, tweets go
    live, etc., without any forgotten channel. The messaging has been
    double-checked for consistency one more time. Any early testers or
    advocates have been given a heads-up so they can share positive
    reviews or testimonials on launch day to build credibility.

-   **Support Lead:** **Freeze support content** -- ensure the knowledge
    base reflects exactly the product we are launching (update any
    screenshots if last-minute UI changed). Set up a way to get rapid
    feedback from support to dev (like a dedicated Slack channel for
    launch issues) so that if multiple users report the same bug or
    confusion, it's instantly seen by the team. Also, brief any
    additional support staff or volunteers for launch (if expecting high
    volume, maybe other team members step in to help). *Deliverable:*
    Launch support plan finalized (who will handle incoming queries, how
    to categorize and escalate them). *Success Criteria:* The support
    team is ready and not overwhelmed: dry-run of answering multiple
    queries at once went okay, and templates for common answers are at
    hand. Support is integrated in the war-room or monitoring channel so
    they can raise flags to the team. Users will feel heard even if
    something goes wrong at launch, because support responds quickly and
    empathetically (tone has been pre-approved for tricky situations,
    e.g. if an outage happens).

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Provide any last-minute advice on launch
    communications. Ensure that any marketing claims are legally sound
    (avoid anything that could be misconstrued, e.g. "Financial immune
    system" is fine as marketing speak, but ensure disclaimers like "not
    a guarantee against loss"). Check that cookie consent or any
    tracking notices are in place on the site at launch if required by
    law. *Deliverable:* Final legal review of outward-facing materials
    (including the app's UI one last time). *Success Criteria:* Launch
    communications carry no legal risk. The website and app include all
    necessary legal links and disclosures. Compliance is satisfied that
    user agreements and policies are effective as soon as users sign up
    or use the product (for example, using the product implies
    acceptance of terms -- that should be stated). With this, Legal
    steps back, with trust in the team to operate within the provided
    guidelines.

## Week 7 -- Launch & Live Monitoring

-   **Architect:** Oversee the system in real conditions as users
    onboard. Verify that the system architecture holds up -- no
    bottlenecks or crashes. Keep an eye on any services (especially the
    indexer and alert pipeline) for scaling issues. If anything
    structurally problematic appears (e.g. queue backups, memory
    spikes), coordinate hotfixes or scaling operations with DevOps
    quickly. *Deliverable:* Architecture stability report after launch
    day 1. *Success Criteria:* The architecture proves itself -- no need
    for major changes under real load. If metrics show some component
    under pressure, a mitigation (add more instances, tweak config) is
    done quickly without downtime. The system remains robust and
    responsive, validating the architectural choices.

-   **Product Owner:** Track launch **KPIs and user feedback** closely.
    Compare actual metrics to success criteria: e.g., what's the average
    Time to First Action for new users (from telemetry)? Is it under 5s
    as
    hoped[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20)?
    Are users actually revoking allowances (i.e., core feature
    engagement \> some threshold)? Consolidate feedback from all
    channels (support tickets, social media, analytics) and call out any
    critical issues to address in Week 8. *Deliverable:* Daily status
    summaries of product performance and user sentiment during launch
    week. *Success Criteria:* Key goals are met or exceeded (for
    example, within first 3 days, X allowances revoked, Y% of users
    found at least one high-risk allowance, etc.). If any metric is
    lagging (e.g. bounce rate \>30% which is above
    target[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20)),
    the team acknowledges it and devises a quick fix or patch (maybe a
    quick UX tweak or additional guidance to users if needed). Product
    Owner ensures the team remains focused on maintaining quality during
    the excitement of launch.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Monitor real user interaction via any UX
    tools (session replays, feedback forms). If patterns emerge (users
    getting stuck or not noticing a feature), propose immediate small UX
    improvements. Perhaps run a quick **"launch usability test"**:
    recruit a couple of new users from outside and have them share
    screen as they use the just-launched product to see if anything
    unexpected crops up. Also respond to any UI/UX issues flagged by
    early users (like if someone points out an icon is unclear, consider
    replacing it quickly if minor). *Deliverable:* List of any UX
    enhancements or quick fixes identified from real-world use. *Success
    Criteria:* The product continues to exemplify clarity in the face of
    real users. Any minor UX snags discovered are addressed via content
    updates or minor patches in Week 8 (without undermining stability).
    Positive feedback from users about the UI's clarity is a strong
    signal -- aim to gather a few testimonials or quotes like "the
    interface is so easy to understand."

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** Keep watch on the on-chain activity.
    Ensure transactions are flowing smoothly and confirm on Etherscan
    that revocations are succeeding. If any user transactions fail
    (maybe due to gas or nonce issues), investigate and adjust app
    defaults (for instance, if gas estimates were off). Assist
    support/dev team in troubleshooting any blockchain-specific problems
    that arise (like weird tokens that don't follow standards).
    *Deliverable:* On-chain transaction log analysis report after launch
    week (e.g. number of revoke txs, success rate, any common failure
    reason). *Success Criteria:* \>95% of revoke transactions initiated
    through the app are successful on first try (if not, investigate and
    improve instructions or defaults). No unforeseen smart contract
    issues (like reentrancy or others) occurred -- basically zero
    incidents related to the contract. The contract engineer might also
    start thinking of next steps (like multi-chain deployment if lots of
    requests, but that's beyond immediate scope).

-   **Backend Lead:** Ensure server stability as traffic hits.
    Continuously monitor logs for errors or slow queries. If any
    endpoint is frequently failing or timing out (perhaps the indexer
    struggling with a certain token's data), apply fixes or
    optimizations (live patch if needed in Week 8's cycle). Also watch
    the alert pipeline -- check that alerts are being generated and sent
    out correctly as new approvals happen in user wallets.
    *Deliverable:* Backend performance & error report during launch.
    *Success Criteria:* Server error rate remains very low (e.g. \<1%
    error responses). Average response times remain within the budget
    (p95 maybe \<500ms as planned). The alert pipeline successfully
    caught any relevant events (if a beta user or early user granted a
    new allowance, an alert was recorded and possibly delivered). No
    data integrity issues in the database (e.g. duplicates, missing
    records). If any bug surfaces (like an edge case crash), a ticket is
    filed and a hotfix scheduled promptly.

-   **Frontend Lead:** Rapidly address any UI bugs or compatibility
    issues discovered once the product is in the wild. If some users on
    certain devices have layout issues or a JavaScript error appears,
    diagnose and patch if critical (via a point release). Also
    incorporate any small improvements that don't require backend
    changes -- e.g. tweaking text or styles that can be done quickly to
    improve clarity or fix errors (with Product Owner approval for
    post-launch patch). Keep an eye on performance from real users
    (using the RUM data or analytics) to ensure our optimizations hold
    up. *Deliverable:* Any necessary hotfix releases to frontend
    (v1.0.1, etc.) addressing high-priority issues found after launch.
    *Success Criteria:* The front-end remains polished under wider
    usage. If no hotfix is needed, that means our QA was excellent. If a
    hotfix is needed, it is delivered swiftly and resolves the problem
    (verified by users). Real user performance metrics (p75) are in the
    green for CWV (we'll get early data -- e.g. LCP from real users is
    indeed around 1.5-2s as expected). Accessibility in practice: no
    reports from users with disabilities having problems; ideally some
    positive feedback if we had those testers.

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Monitor all systems closely (probably on high alert
    on launch day and the days after). Scale resources as needed -- if
    traffic is higher than anticipated, be ready to allocate more
    servers/instances on the fly to maintain performance. Keep track of
    any production incidents (even minor ones) in a log, including
    response and resolution times. Set up a post-launch incident review
    meeting for any that occurred (for Week 8). *Deliverable:*
    Production monitoring updates (real-time dashboards shared with
    team) and an incident log. *Success Criteria:* Zero downtime during
    launch. If scaling was needed, it happened without users noticing
    any slowdown. The system auto-scaling or manual scaling ensured no
    performance degradation. All alerts triggered were handled (and none
    were missed). Essentially, the SRE function prevents any technical
    issue from escalating into a user-visible problem by being
    proactive.

-   **Security Researcher:** Be vigilant for any security-related
    reports or signs of misuse now that the app is public. Check
    analytics or logs for any abnormal patterns (e.g. a single IP making
    thousands of requests -- could be a scan; address it via rate
    limiting if needed). If any external security researcher or user
    reports a vulnerability, immediately verify and escalate to dev for
    patch (following the disclosure policy). *Deliverable:* Security
    incident log (hopefully empty) and a validation that all systems
    (esp. new telemetry or monitoring) are not leaking data. *Success
    Criteria:* No security incidents in the first week. If one arises,
    it's handled within hours (patch or mitigation deployed, users
    informed if necessary). The user trust is maintained; ideally, get
    confirmation from a third-party or internal check that the app is
    secure (maybe run one more scan in production just to be sure
    nothing was missed).

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Start analyzing the initial usage data to generate
    insights. For example, how many allowances does the average user
    have? What fraction were high risk? Did the presence of risk
    labeling actually lead users to revoke those versus others? Gather
    stats on Time Machine usage as well (did users try it out? if not,
    maybe it needs more prominence or explanation). These insights will
    guide the team in adjusting messaging or features. Also verify that
    the clarity telemetry (glanceability, error rates, etc.) is within
    targets with real user data -- e.g., if the average
    reading_grade_level recorded is higher than desired, that's a red
    flag to address. *Deliverable:* Early data insights report (with
    graphs or stats on key metrics) delivered to team. *Success
    Criteria:* The data confirms the product's value: e.g., "In the
    first 3 days, 70% of users revoked at least one risky allowance,
    removing on average 5 approvals per wallet." If some metrics are
    off, those are clearly identified (for instance, if Error Rate
    telemetry shows 5% on some action -- above 2% target -- the team is
    alerted). The ML lead also ensures any machine learning pipelines
    (if any in production) are running fine -- likely none yet, but if
    risk scoring was static rules, this remains stable.

-   **Growth Marketer:** Measure launch campaign effectiveness. Track
    how many visitors, sign-ups, conversions we got from each channel.
    Compare against targets. Engage with the community: respond to
    tweets or questions, clarify any misunderstandings publicly to
    maintain the narrative. Possibly start case studies or gather user
    success stories to use in ongoing marketing. Also watch for any
    **reputation issues**: e.g., if any negative feedback arises on
    forums, address it or feed it back to the team to fix.
    *Deliverable:* Launch marketing report (traffic, user acquisition
    numbers, community feedback summary). *Success Criteria:* Achieve or
    exceed initial user acquisition goals (for example, if target was
    1000 wallets connected in first week, measure progress). The
    sentiment on social media is positive -- people praising clarity or
    usefulness. Any PR that appears (articles, reviews) are tracked and
    shared with the team. The growth plan for the next stage is adjusted
    based on what worked (double down on channels that brought quality
    users).

-   **Support Lead:** This is the real test -- handle actual user
    support tickets/issues coming in. Ensure the support SLA (even if
    informal) is met -- for launch, aim for super fast responses to
    impress early adopters. Collect and categorize the issues: how many
    are "how to" questions (which might indicate something unclear in
    UI), how many are bug reports, etc. Share this with the team daily
    so that any frequent issue can be fixed or addressed in
    documentation quickly. *Deliverable:* Support ticket log and summary
    of top issues for engineering review. *Success Criteria:* Users are
    satisfied with support responses (maybe measure via any feedback
    mechanism after ticket resolution). Volume of tickets is manageable,
    indicating that the product is not overly confusing or broken (if we
    get flooded with tickets, something's wrong in UX or quality). By
    end of launch week, support has prepared an updated FAQ covering any
    new common questions discovered. The number of support requests per
    user stays low after initial curiosity, showing the product is
    largely self-explanatory.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Monitor for any compliance-related issues
    post-launch. This could include users from jurisdictions that raise
    concerns (like if suddenly many EU users sign up, ensure GDPR
    processes are in place for data requests; or if any regulator or
    platform queries our service). Make sure the process for users to
    contact us for privacy or terms issues is working (e.g. if someone
    emails to delete their data, does support/dev handle it swiftly?).
    *Deliverable:* Compliance post-launch check-in report. *Success
    Criteria:* No legal complaints or takedown requests out of the gate.
    The Privacy email/contact did not receive any complaints (or if it
    did, they were resolved amicably). The product is operating within
    the law, and any necessary post-launch compliance tasks (like
    analytics usage disclosure, etc.) are being done properly. If the
    growth included any contests or promotions, ensure legal reviewed
    those as well.

## Week 8 -- Post-Launch Stabilization & Retrospective

-   **Architect:** Conduct a **post-mortem / retrospective** on the
    technical execution. Analyze what went well and what didn't in terms
    of architecture and process. Document any lessons learned (e.g.
    "Next time, invest more in automated testing for X component" or
    "Our clarity-first approach paid off in reduced support tickets").
    Also start planning any architectural improvements for the next
    version (maybe multi-chain support, scaling out the indexer
    differently, etc.) but do not implement them now -- just capture in
    technical backlog. *Deliverable:* Technical retrospective document
    and backlog of future improvements. *Success Criteria:* Team
    alignment that the architecture served its purpose; any incidents
    were due to known trade-offs or unforeseen issues that are now
    understood. There is a clear path to address any tech debt. The
    retrospective yields action items that will be fed into the next
    planning cycle, ensuring continuous improvement.

-   **Product Owner:** Wrap up the sprint with a **success metrics
    review**. Compare the final outcomes to the goals set at the
    beginning (clarity metrics, user adoption, etc.). If all success
    criteria are met, celebrate that with the team; if some fell short,
    identify why and create a plan to tackle those in the next
    iterations. Organize a meeting to acknowledge achievements and thank
    each role for hitting the "God-tier" quality bar. Also, ensure all
    remaining open issues from launch are either resolved in quick
    patches or scheduled for future sprints (none left unowned).
    *Deliverable:* Final Sprint Report / Product Summary (covering what
    was delivered, key metrics, remaining TODOs). *Success Criteria:*
    Stakeholders are happy with the outcome -- e.g., internal demo or
    report to executives shows that Allowance Guard 2.0 delivered on its
    promise (with evidence like reduced user risk, positive feedback).
    The team has a clear understanding of the product's trajectory and
    any next steps. All critical fixes from launch are done by end of
    Week 8, leaving the product in a stable state.

-   **UX Designer/Writer:** Take stock of the **user experience
    outcomes**. Possibly conduct a quick survey or gather testimonials
    from actual users focusing on UX ("Did you feel in control of your
    wallet security using our product?", "Was anything confusing?"). Use
    any recorded sessions or feedback logs to identify any deeper UX
    improvements for the future (like maybe an onboarding tutorial might
    help if some users didn't understand something initially). Ensure
    the design system and documentation are updated to reflect the final
    product (so future designers or devs have the latest source of
    truth). *Deliverable:* UX post-launch report with user feedback
    highlights and proposed enhancements. *Success Criteria:* The
    clarity of Allowance Guard 2.0 is validated by users -- ideally,
    metrics like comprehension (90%+ first-time correct
    understanding[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20))
    and low error rates are confirmed. The UX report might say "90% of
    surveyed users found the app very easy to use, 10% had minor
    suggestions which we can address." The brand and design elements
    remained consistent under pressure, proving the PuredgeOS 3.0
    guidelines effective.

-   **Smart Contract Engineer:** If any minor contract updates are
    needed post-launch (perhaps to extend functionality or fix a minor
    bug discovered), plan that now: write the code and tests but only
    deploy once thoroughly vetted. If not, focus on documenting the
    smart contract usage and performance from launch. Perhaps compile
    stats like how many allowances revoked through contract vs direct,
    and gas costs saved by batch if that was implemented. Feed this data
    to the team for bragging rights or case studies ("we saved users X
    in gas by batch processing"). *Deliverable:* Post-launch contract
    analysis and any patch code (un-deployed, for review). *Success
    Criteria:* No emergency fixes needed on the contract (meaning our
    initial deployment was solid). Any planned improvements are low
    priority and can be scheduled later. The contract's success is
    measured (e.g., it handled Y transactions with 0 failures). The
    engineer might also propose future enhancements like supporting new
    token standards or chains based on user requests, captured as
    backlog items.

-   **Backend Lead:** Clean up and stabilize the codebase after the
    flurry of launch. Remove any launch-specific debug code or temporary
    logs that were added. Ensure the alerting/monitoring thresholds are
    adjusted now that real baseline is known (maybe lower some
    thresholds if we got too many false positives or vice versa). Also,
    re-run the full test suite in the production environment to ensure
    everything still passes (especially if any hotfixes were applied).
    Plan database maintenance if needed (backup, index optimizations
    after initial data load). *Deliverable:* Maintenance updates to
    backend and updated documentation for operations (like any changes
    in configs after launch). *Success Criteria:* The backend remains
    healthy and maintainable. No lingering crash reports or errors in
    logs that aren't addressed. The codebase is tagged and archived for
    the v2.0 release for future reference. The team can confidently
    reduce "all-hands-on-deck" monitoring as the system proves stable
    over a week or two.

-   **Frontend Lead:** Merge any final minor fixes and then tag the
    stable release. Perhaps implement small UX improvements identified
    from user feedback if trivial (e.g. adding a tooltip here or
    tweaking a style) now that the pressure is lower -- but avoid any
    risky changes. Pay down any front-end tech debt: maybe refine some
    code that was rushed, add comments or better tests for complex
    components like Time Machine. *Deliverable:* Final polished
    front-end build (v1.0.X) incorporating minor improvements, and
    documentation for front-end (components guide, any quirks). *Success
    Criteria:* The front-end quality is at a long-term maintainable
    state. All core components have unit tests (if some were skipped
    pre-launch, add them now). The app has no known UI bugs outstanding.
    Front-end metrics in production (web vitals, etc.) are consistently
    within targets and now serve as baseline for future releases.
    Essentially, the front-end lead is comfortable handing off the code
    to any new engineer because it's clean and well-documented
    post-launch.

-   **DevOps/SRE:** Scale down any unnecessary resources after the
    initial surge if appropriate (e.g. if extra instances were added and
    now usage is moderate, optimize costs). Conduct a **post-launch
    infrastructure review**: check that all systems (servers, databases,
    third-party services) handled the load and see if any limits were
    hit (e.g. did we get close to rate limits on an API?). Ensure
    backups are running periodically now that real data is in system
    (and test a backup restore to be sure). Write a summary of how the
    infra responded to launch and any recommendations (maybe "we should
    move to a dedicated node provider for faster blockchain queries in
    the future" if that was an issue, etc.). *Deliverable:*
    Infrastructure report and updated runbooks (including any changes
    made during launch). *Success Criteria:* The infrastructure is
    right-sized for steady state. No costly overruns or inefficiencies
    remain. The SRE confirms that the system can now run with normal
    monitoring (no need for 24/7 war-room) since it's proven stable. Any
    potential improvements (like using a CDN for certain API responses
    or enabling more caching) are noted for future implementation to
    further improve performance or cost.

-   **Security Researcher:** Perform a final **compliance audit** now
    that everything is live. Ensure we didn't inadvertently violate any
    privacy promises (e.g. telemetry data stored longer than stated,
    etc.). If applicable, compile data for any security certifications
    or audits that might be pursued (maybe not in this timeline, but
    have records ready). Summarize the security posture after one week:
    all systems patched, no incidents, any pending low-severity issues
    scheduled. *Deliverable:* Final security status report for v2.0.
    *Success Criteria:* The app remains secure post-launch with no new
    issues. Any minor vulnerabilities discovered are already patched or
    scheduled. The team can proudly say we have had zero security
    breaches and we have a plan to keep it that way. The security
    researcher might also set up routine scans or periodic audits going
    forward (maybe plan a 3-month post-launch full audit), ensuring
    ongoing vigilance.

-   **Data/ML Lead:** Now with a week of real data, produce a **detailed
    analytics report** showing the impact of Allowance Guard 2.0.
    Include charts of risk levels distribution, number of revokes, how
    users responded to alerts, etc. Also evaluate the clarity metrics:
    from telemetry, gather average glanceability time, error rate in
    flows, reading grade levels of content if that was measured (we
    instrumented it, so likely we have an average reading grade from
    events)[\[18\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=until%20needed%29,and%20reflect%20our%20brand%20personality)[\[15\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=These%20mappings%20are%20documented%20and,0.02).
    Report these back to illustrate we hit our clarity goals (e.g.
    "Average time to first action: 4.2s, Error rate in onboarding:
    1.5%[\[2\]](file://file-KPMkCTDBDHQiKUHiSB4wp8#:~:text=ideal,old%20test%5B20),
    Reading level avg: 7.8 grade -- all within targets"). Identify any
    opportunities for using ML in the future (maybe patterns suggest we
    could train a model to predict risky allowances beyond the
    rule-based approach). *Deliverable:* Post-launch data report and
    recommendations. *Success Criteria:* The product's value is
    demonstrated through data -- for instance, we can show that users
    who got alerts responded by revoking X% of the time, or overall risk
    scores of users dropped by an average of Y% after using the tool.
    Clarity metrics ideally meet the PuredgeOS thresholds proving the UX
    was indeed instantly understandable (if not, pinpoint which pillar
    needs improvement). The team has actionable data-driven insights for
    the next iteration (like which features were least used might be
    pruned or improved).

-   **Growth Marketer:** Shift from launch to **growth & retention**
    mode. Analyze user activation and retention in the first week: how
    many are returning vs one-time use? Develop a plan to re-engage
    those who signed up but didn't complete an action (maybe an email
    campaign like "You have 3 risky allowances, come back and fix them!"
    if appropriate and compliant). Collect success stories or
    testimonials from enthusiastic early users to use in marketing.
    *Deliverable:* Growth plan for the next 30 days post-launch
    (covering user engagement, possibly referrals, content marketing
    based on initial results). *Success Criteria:* Early retention
    numbers are good or being addressed (e.g. if retention is low, plan
    is in place to improve it). The product sees organic growth (maybe
    some community shared it further). Marketing cost per acquisition
    and other funnel metrics are tracked and within acceptable range.
    The growth strategy is refined now that real user behavior is known
    (for instance, if a feature like Time Machine turned out very
    popular, highlight it more in marketing; if not, figure out if
    messaging needed improvement).

-   **Support Lead:** Winding down from intense launch support, but
    ensure ongoing support processes are sustainable. Perhaps create a
    **FAQ section within the app** or chat-bot with answers if volume
    merits it, to reduce direct tickets. Schedule any training for
    additional support team members if expecting user base to grow. Also
    gather all the unique support issues encountered and feed them into
    the product backlog or knowledge base as needed. *Deliverable:*
    Updated support knowledge resources and a short report on support
    load and performance during launch. *Success Criteria:* Support
    volume normalized (e.g., after initial burst, it's trending down as
    issues are resolved and product is stable). The average handle time
    and resolution quality was good, with perhaps \>90% of tickets
    resolved satisfactorily. The support lead can now move to a
    maintenance routine where new issues are infrequent and mostly edge
    cases. Users have multiple avenues to get help (documentations,
    etc.) so they don\'t rely solely on contacting support.

-   **Legal/Compliance:** Archive all legal documentation and ensure
    everything is versioned properly now that the product launched (the
    ToS version that launched, etc.). Address any pending legal to-dos
    that weren't urgent before launch, like filing a trademark for the
    product name if not done, or open-source attributions on a site page
    if needed. Evaluate if any longer-term compliance tasks are needed
    (like if we plan to get a security certification or if user data
    handling might need a DPIA for GDPR). *Deliverable:* Compliance
    checklist completed (or updated for next phase). *Success Criteria:*
    The company's legal compliance stance is solid after launch: all
    required policies are in use, no outstanding risks. Legal is now in
    a monitoring mode rather than active development mode, ready to
    assist if new features are planned or if any incident happens. The
    hand-off to routine legal processes (like periodic policy reviews)
    is established.

Finally, with all tasks completed and quality gates passed, **Allowance
Guard 2.0** is delivered as a launch-quality product. Each role has
clear deliverables and success metrics each week, ensuring a coordinated
execution that enforces clarity, performance, accessibility, and
security at every step. This meticulous 60-day plan results in a Web3
financial safety tool that not only functions robustly but sets a new
bar for user experience clarity and trust in the Web3 security space.
